# APSIC Pitch Deck
**AI Public Safety Intake Commander**

---

## 🎯 Slide 1: Title

# APSIC
## AI Public Safety Intake Commander

**Codename:** SentinelCredits

*Intelligent multimodal AI for public safety incident triage*

---

## 🚨 Slide 2: The Problem

### Public Safety Reporting is Broken

**Fragmented chaos across cities, schools, and enterprises:**
- Reports arrive in different formats (text, images, audio, video) with no unified system
- Human reviewers are overwhelmed, causing inconsistent triage and delayed responses
- Critical incidents get buried in noise while low-priority cases waste resources

**The cost?** Lives at risk, liability exposure, and zero institutional memory.

---

## ✨ Slide 3: The Solution

### Meet APSIC: Your AI Safety Commander

**APSIC transforms chaos into intelligent action:**
- Analyzes text, images, audio, and video in seconds using multimodal AI
- Classifies severity, suggests actions, and routes cases automatically
- Learns from past incidents to detect patterns and improve responses

**One submission. Instant triage. Complete audit trail.**

---

## ⚙️ Slide 4: How It Works

### The APSIC Pipeline

```
📥 INTAKE → 🧠 UNDERSTAND → 🎯 DECIDE → 👁️ REVIEW → 📋 DELIVER
```

**1. INTAKE** - Capture multimodal input (text + media)
**2. UNDERSTAND** - Gemini AI extracts entities, classifies severity, summarizes
**3. DECIDE** - Rules + AI validate routing (log, review, escalate, immediate)
**4. REVIEW** - Agentic + human oversight for high-severity cases
**5. DELIVER** - Complete audit log with similar incident recommendations

*Every decision is traceable, auditable, and explainable.*
